epaper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  A very simple example that just text "SPRESENSE" in the center of the ePaper
  device.

  ePaper device is almost the same with LCD and FB display devices but refresh
  timing is differ.
  Its driver must call non-standard refreshing interface to show on the display.

  This example supports only ET014TT1 Eink device.
